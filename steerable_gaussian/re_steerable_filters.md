# Steerable filter introduction

- [Steerable Pyramid: Theory of Steerable Filters](https://rafat.github.io/sites/wavebook/advanced/steer.html)

### Second-order steerable filters

- 2-nd derivative Gaussian filters of different orientations
- examples illustrated = oriented spatial functions 
- filters are convolved with the images and data derived from along the axons is retained 
    - non-maximum suppression removes data which does not lie on ridges of high intensity ~ to surrounding landscape 

### Interpolation 

- [information is lost any time an image is rotated](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-interpolation.htm)
- hence, interpolation functions

### Separability and SVD

- [See Fig. 1C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579723/)
    > "Images were imported into MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and convolved with a bank of three 2D 2nd-derivative Gaussian filters of width 1.8 Î¼m. The maximum filter response was calculated. The method is described in full in Freeman and Adelson [11]."

    - > The steerableDetector function was applied to reconstructed SIM images and a rastered STORM image with a fourth order filter. The Euclidean minimum spanning tree, Delaunay triangulation, and Voronoi tessellation of SMLM STORM data were computed using the Computational Geometry functions and the Bioinformatics Toolbox of MATLAB after loading the molecule list from Nikon Elements.
