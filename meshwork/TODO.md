## Actin mesh size/density analysis 

- [ ] What is the **cytosolic** actin network? Is it 0-1 $\mu$ m? 
    - cytosolic and basal network 
- [ ] Use the new deconvolved images to finish actin meshwork analysis.
    - [ ] get mesh size
    - [ ] start with untransduced cells; then CARs
    - [ ] start with 3/8 min, "pretty" ones 
        - [ ] ignore images with B7!! 
- [ ] Untransduced 3/8 min: 
    - [ ] paper Fig 1C = 3 min?
    - [X] check if images are with patterns/ring in that fig 
- [ ] Fig 1A 3D z-projection

----

## Current analysis pipeline priorities

- [ ] **Normalise** --> **steer 2o Gauss** --> **min z proj** --> **threshold** 
    - do for all deconvolved images of interest 
- [ ] use spreadsheet to choose focal plane for **min z proj** 
- [ ] adapt morphological operations to suit the data (lol)
- [ ]

## Steerable filter matters 

- correlation is what i thought covolution was (going top-bottom and left-right)
- [ ] make intermediate Gaussian figures to be used in write up
- [ ] write up bits of the methods section 
- [ ] take filter in six orientations and average of outputs
